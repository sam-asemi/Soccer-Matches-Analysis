Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches


Two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match since the 19th century have been scraped from a reliable online source. This data is stored in two CSV files: women_results.csv and men_results.csv.

Question:
Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?


Assume a 10% significance level, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:

H0: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.

Ha: The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.
